This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to type handling in functions. The `calculateSum` function is designed to calculate the sum of numbers in an array.  However, it lacks robust type checking. When an array containing both numeric and string values is passed, a runtime error occurs because PHP cannot implicitly convert the string to a number for addition. The solution implements type checking to prevent this error.
